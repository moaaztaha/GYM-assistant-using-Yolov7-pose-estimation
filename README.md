# AI GYM Helper
### Pose Estimation Project

This project is about counting curls and making sure elbows are tucked in using YOLOv7 for pose estimation. We will be using OpenCV and YOLOv7 to detect the human body parts and then estimate the angle between the three points chosen.

### Demo


### Installation
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary packages in `requirements.txt`.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moaaztaha/GYM-assistant-using-Yolov7-pose-estimation
cd  GYM-assistant-using-Yolov7-pose-estimation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
